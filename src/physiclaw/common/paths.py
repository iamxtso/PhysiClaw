File-format rule — the mix above is deliberate, one format per audience
(the Python-community split: TOML for what humans edit, JSON for what
machines write):

    config.toml     the ONE user-edited settings file → TOML
    <name>.yml,     the deliberate YAML exceptions: user-edited automation
    APP.yml,        specs (macro step flows, pack pages, playbook routes)
    PLAYBOOK.yml
                    follow the GitHub-Actions shape, and YAML's
                    implicit-typing hazards are fenced by a 1.2 parser +
                    strict type checks (macros/parse.py,
                    conductor/pages.py)
    *.json/*.jsonl  machine-written state, caches, and append-only logs
                    (jq-able; source.json mirrors the upstream manifest
                    verbatim)
    *.md            agent-facing documents (memory, jobs, pitfalls)

New files follow this rule; don't convert one format to another for
uniformity's sake.
