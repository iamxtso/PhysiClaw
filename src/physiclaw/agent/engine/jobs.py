"""Engine-side job integration.

In-process replacement for the bash-CLI loopback `claude -p` used. This
module:
  - extracts cron-fired job ids from Triggers,
  - formats firings into the SYSTEM prompt,
  - creates new jobs when the model's response includes `create_job`.

Outcome marking is the agent's responsibility via `finish_job` — there
is no engine-side fallback. Jobs forgotten in `fired` status remain
there until the agent explicitly closes them.

Data model + jobs.md I/O lives in `physiclaw.agent.engine.job_store`. The hook
that actually ticks and fires is `physiclaw.agent.hooks.cron`.
