"""``physiclaw macros`` — author, rehearse, and track gesture macros.

The user's side of `physiclaw.macros`: `init` scaffolds one, `list` shows
what's on disk, `check` lints every macro file (printing exactly why a
file is excluded), `runs` replays a past run's per-step log,
`run` rehearses one macro against the live server — the mandatory test
step before setting ``enabled: true``, and it takes ``--start-at`` so the
resumed path the agent can take is rehearsable too — and `stats` shows the run
counters the runner records. Rehearsals count in stats on purpose
(`runner.run_and_record` owns that fold, shared with the engine): a
successful rehearsal is evidence the path works and resets
``consecutive_aborts``.
