"""Capture — mine learned page geometry from on-device observations.

Fingerprint geometry is never authored or shipped: given N observations
of a declared page on the actual device, this module mines anchor
positions/tolerances/variants and reports how the page's whole rule
(every anchor shows, no forbid term does) fares on its own genuine
observations and on same-app negatives — an inseparable page is
visible instead of silent. First-run capture (system pages) and
rehearsal-as-capture (pack pages) call `capture_app`, the one entry that
produces finished `LearnedPage`s; the conductor CLI feeds it recorded
sessions and live peeks.
