"""The callable seams a driver takes — typed once, so every skin and
every test passes the same shapes.

A rehearsal, a stepped node, or a macro run is driven by four hooks:
where progress lines go, who sees every real result, who may rewrite
a result before the walk reads it (the virtual channel), and who
receives each model round-trip. None of them return anything the
driver reads back, except `Transform`, whose non-None answer replaces
the result. The phone side is `macros.runner.McpCaller`, the one MCP
shape the whole tree drives through.
