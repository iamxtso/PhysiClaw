"""Activation — the boot's menu, its one parse_task call, and the
program a positive answer builds.

`discover` reads every pack on disk once at wake: the entries the boot
may offer (enabled and live), the whole dispatch table, and the roster
— every playbook with its state — the wake log prints so a plain model
session never leaves "why no playbook?" to guesswork. `Activation`
turns a THREAD screen into the scoped parse_task request and its
outcome into a `Program` — the baton the boot's `select` step
(`steps/select.py`) hands the conductor. Reaching the thread is the
boot route's job; this owns only the menu, the call, and the build.
