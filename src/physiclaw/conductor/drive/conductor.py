"""Conductor — orchestration only: decide who produces each turn.

While a walk is live the turn loop never calls the provider; it asks
``Conductor.advance()``, which drives the walk (`program.py`), brokers
its model requests through the micro-caller (`micro/channel.py`), and — when
the walk goes quiet — takes the baton it may hand on (the boot's
`select` step built the program the thread asked for) and drives
that. With no walk left it answers None, "not mine", and the loop
calls the provider with the context the runtime curated.

Going quiet is permanent for the session: a walk that handed over is
dropped, not retried — the transcript of its turns IS the handoff. The
conductor holds no session state; context, compaction, and wire
logging stay with the engine.
