"""Gate reply reading — the deterministic reading of the ask's reply.

Ruled order: (0) there must be a NEW incoming message at all — no new
bubble, no check; (1) the NEWEST message decides, by exact word match
on the WHOLE message, normalized, against the words the ASK ITSELF
declares (`yes:` / `no:`) — the conductor holds no word list of its
own. Whole-message equality is the discipline: "ok, but make it two
boxes" contains "ok" yet carries a qualifier that changes the order —
anything the declared words do not cover is the model's to read off
the thread (the walk hands over).

The screen is a thread with the keyboard often up (a send leaves it
raised): the key rows and the predictive bar above them are never
messages, nor is the status bar above the thread (its clock ticks) or
a lone letter (an avatar doodle OCRs as one) — recognized by shape
and skipped.

New-message detection is positional first, set-difference second. We
know what we sent: the ask's text is kept, and `ask_band` finds that
bubble on the thread by its words. A bubble BELOW our visible ask is
newer than the ask by construction and counts whatever it says — a
reply that repeats a word already on screen must not vanish. Which
side a row hangs from (`side_of`) is read from its center against the
IM's incoming box (`incoming_box`), and only for a row narrow enough
to show a side. Only when position cannot tell — the ask scrolled off,
or a sweep above it — do the side and the baseline (the label set
snapshotted when our ask landed) decide what is new.

OCR is not exact: a row reads as ours by a run of consecutive
characters found in the ask, the ask's end by its last few characters
with one allowed misread, and a wrapped tail under an ask whose end
was not read is claimed as ours whatever it reads as.
