"""The call table — one row per micro-call type: its answer space, its
legend, its outcome mapping, and whether it rides the session thread.
Adding a call type is one row of `SPECS`; the texts are `prompts.py`,
the episode vocabulary `spec.calls`, the shapes `decision.py`.

Every prompt is fixed-shape: the contract (`reason` first, then the
word, then `confidence`), the material note, the legend. A screen
enters as the model's own turns see it — the frame the tool result
carried beside its whole element listing — the listing stamped as data
(`data_block`), never compressed. The rows say what a call is;
`compose.py` turns a request into the messages the channel sends.
