"""Micro-calls — the conductor's scoped model calls, one channel.

Two live in an agent step: `agent_fields` (a pure-text call: the
author's prompt in, declared fields out) and `agent_act` (one episode
turn: a tool call — tap, scroll, back, run_macro, done, or escalate,
each with its own args). Three more are the session's thread
(`thread.py`), which asks about the errand rather than a screen:
`parse_task` (does the chat thread assign a task a playbook covers?),
`read_reply` (a reply the ask's own yes/no words could not decide) and
`summarize` (the record a completed walk closes on). Each call's shape
is ONE row of `calltable.SPECS`; the shapes are `decision.py`, the
reply reader `answers.py`.

`MicroCaller` is the channel: one provider call with one transient
retry, one repair retry on a reply the call's own rules refuse, a
confidence judged against the config floor, and every round-trip in
the trace and the wire log. Anything else resolves to no outcome and
the walk hands over — escalation, never a guess. Wired by `plugin.py`
off the setup context.
