"""
PhysiClaw orchestrator — the agent's action surface.

A thin facade that composes the two orchestration halves and keeps only
the tool operations the MCP layer exposes:

- ``rig`` (:class:`HardwareRig`) — devices, calibration, the busy lock,
  lifecycle, and primitive positioning moves;
- ``perception`` (:class:`Perception`) — detectors, frame acquisition,
  the watchdog, and the exposure tune.

Everything gesture-shaped funnels through the single validated dispatch
(``_execute``) under the single lock + observation bracket
(``_observed``). Consumers that don't gesture (calibration and
hardware-setup handlers) take the rig directly and never see this
surface. Image processing lives in physiclaw.core.vision — the
orchestrator never touches pixels.
