"""Warm-start: resume from the saved Calibration bundle.

``try_resume`` (called only when ``physiclaw server --warm-start`` or
``--hot-start`` is passed) loads the bundle from disk into
``rig.calibration``, reconnects hardware, runs an end-to-end sanity tap,
and flips the ready flag only if every test passes. ``--hot-start``
(``verify=False``) is the same resume minus every step that touches the
phone: no bridge wait, no sanity tap, no home-screen swipe — the user
vouches that nothing moved. A plain ``physiclaw server`` boot ignores
the bundle entirely — see ``core/server/app.py``.

The resting-position invariant is what makes warm-start work at all. The
arm parks at the off-screen spot (``PARK_PCT``) between every operation
and on clean shutdown, so on reconnect the tip is sitting there — not at
the calibrated origin. ``arm.setup()``'s ``G92 X0 Y0`` would wrongly
declare the park spot to be ``(0, 0)`` and shift the whole frame, so
``restore_park_origin`` re-pins the origin from the park coordinate to
keep ``pct_to_grbl`` valid. The sanity tap is the only mechanism that
catches violations of this invariant (crash mid-move, power cut, arm
bumped — anything that leaves the tip somewhere other than the park
spot). Under ``--hot-start`` nothing catches them: the first symptom of
a violated invariant is a gesture landing off-target.
