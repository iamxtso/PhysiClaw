"""Physical device control for PhysiClaw.

GRBL stylus arm, OpenCV camera, and AssistiveTouch screenshot pipeline.
Knows nothing about the bridge, calibration, orchestration, or server
layers (enforced by tests/test_architecture.py). Two leaf dependencies
are deliberate: the exposure/focus policies consume ``core.vision``'s
pure quality metrics, and coordinate contracts come from
``core.geometry``.
