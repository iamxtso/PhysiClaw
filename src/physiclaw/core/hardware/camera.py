Camera module — reusable Camera class and CLI test utilities.

Usage as library:

    cam = Camera(index=0)
    frame = cam.snapshot()
    cam.close()

Usage as CLI:
    uv run python -m physiclaw.camera              # scan all cameras
    uv run python -m physiclaw.camera --index 0    # live preview (q=quit, s=save)
    uv run python -m physiclaw.camera --snap 0     # save one frame

Note: On macOS, OpenCV won't trigger the camera permission dialog.
If the camera returns blank frames, run `imagesnap` once first to
grant camera access to your terminal app, then retry.
