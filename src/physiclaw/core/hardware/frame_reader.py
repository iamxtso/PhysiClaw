"""FrameReader — keep a capture stream warm and self-healing.

A background daemon thread continuously pulls frames via an injected
``read_frame`` callable and publishes the latest one; callers get it
through ``fresh_frame()`` / ``wait_frames()`` without blocking on the
native capture. The supervisor policy lives here too: reconnect (via
the injected ``reopen``) when frames go stale, give up and interrupt
the main thread when the drought outlasts ``FATAL_AFTER_SECONDS`` —
reopen can't revive a stream the OS has cut (display sleep, bus
suspend), and dying cleanly beats spamming the log forever.

Nothing in here knows about cv2 or PhysiClaw semantics — ``Camera``
composes a FrameReader with a lock-wrapped ``cap.read`` and its own
``_reopen``, which is what makes this unit testable with scripted
callables instead of thread-timing-sensitive fakes.
