"""The fake-channel interceptor — the dispatch seam's debug half.

A result TRANSFORMER, not a bypass: every call dispatches for real —
the gate's `channel/send` genuinely drives the phone and the ask really
lands in the IM thread — and only the OBSERVATION of conductor channel
actions is rewritten, so the conversation the walk reads stays the
scripted one. One rule set, three lines of truth:

  - A conductor-minted `run_macro` naming a `channel/*` macro ran for
    real; its result is replaced with a gesture-shaped reply whose
    listing is the virtual thread render. A `channel/send` also appends
    the agent's bubble to the virtual thread. The conductor is now "on
    the thread".
  - A conductor-minted `peek` while on the thread ran for real too; its
    listing is replaced with the same render — the read that also
    releases a staged user reply when an ask is outstanding
    (`thread.py` owns the timing rule).
  - Everything else passes through untouched — and any phone-moving
    tool drops the on-thread state, so the next thread action must
    re-enter through `channel/open` exactly as the walk already does
    (`tried_open` self-heals a mismatch, in debug as in production).

Errors stay real: dispatch transforms only successful block results, so
a failed send propagates and the walk hands over exactly as it would in
production. Model-minted calls are never touched: hidden channel macros
already error for model turns, and the model's own navigation stays
real. Provenance is structural — dispatch passes the session's
`synthesized_turn` bit, the same one the phone-protection policies key
on — never inferred from call-id strings.

State is per-session and deliberately minimal: a fresh interceptor
starts off-thread until a conductor peek reads as the thread, so a
resumed suspension's first gate-peek reads the real phone and, unless
the IM app is already showing the thread, mismatches and re-enters via
the open macro — no cross-wake state to corrupt. A REAL listing that
already reads as the channel thread (the previous session's wrap-up
left the IM app open on it) is virtualized on that peek, or the boot
would parse the real thread — where the last word is the assistant's
own completion report — instead of the scripted one. The thread file is re-read on every render; only the
channel fingerprint is cached (it cannot change mid-session).
