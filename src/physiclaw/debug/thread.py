"""The virtual thread — `debug/thread.json` and its listing renderer.

The file is one scripted conversation: the bubbles so far, plus the
user's `staged` replies waiting for their moment. `physiclaw debug
--task --reply` seeds both; the interceptor appends the agent's own
sends (`record_send`) and reads the thread per peek (`peek_bubbles`),
which is where timing lives: a staged reply enters the thread only when
the newest bubble is the agent's — after an ask, never before one, and
never into the ask's own baseline snapshot (the gate baselines the SEND
result; the release happens on the following peek). One rule covers the
in-session poll, the suspended resume, and multi-ask scripts alike.

`render_listing` draws the thread in the element-listing grammar the
whole system reads, against the REAL channel pack's fingerprint: every
declared anchor of the `thread` page is rendered at its learned position
(else its region band, else spread across the top), so `match_screen`
scores the render like a genuine reading rather than being bypassed.
Bubble geometry carries the semantics `reply.read_incoming` keys on:
incoming bubbles hang from the IM's `incoming_box` side, our own from
the other, newest at the bottom, long texts split into wrapped-line
rows — and a line is as wide as its text, up to the width of a bubble,
so a long line's center drifts toward the middle of the screen exactly
as a real one does (the reader must not lean on a line's center).

Block builders mirror the server's wire shapes (`core/server/tools.py`):
a view reply is `[image, listing]` — block 0 must NOT be text, or
`verdict.action_text` would misread the listing as composed action text
— and a gesture reply is `[action text, image, listing]`.
