"""The extrusion numbers, kept apart from the geometry — the standard-library
half of ``extrusion.py``.

Two readers share these constants. ``extrusion.py`` turns them into
build123d solids (it needs ``--group cad``); the sourcing drawing
(``hardware.manual.build_extrusion_drawing``) turns the same numbers into
the cut-and-drill sheet a supplier machines from, without loading the CAD
kernel. Keeping them here — plain floats in millimetres, no build123d
import — is what lets one edit move both the model and the drawing.

The 2020 cell, the 2040 channel and counterbores, and the 1020 profile
and end holes are all defined here; ``extrusion.py`` re-exports every
name, so its importers (the assembly procedures) are unchanged.
