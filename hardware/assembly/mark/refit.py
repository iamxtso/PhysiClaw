"""Refit a patch's highlight polygons from the model.

A highlight traced by hand in the mark UI is geometry frozen against one
render; when the part it outlines moves or changes shape, the polygon
silently stops fitting. This tool recomputes each highlight as the exact
projected silhouette of the parts it covers, using the same camera the
render used, and replays the patch:

    uv run --group cad python -m hardware refit \\
        hardware/assembly/patch/linear_10_y_exploded_cam0.json --parts Screw TNut

``--parts`` names the top-level children of the step's compound to
outline, by label prefix (``Screw`` matches ``Screw_BHCS_M3x8``). The
selection is recorded on the op as ``parts`` so a later refit of the same
patch needs no arguments. Every op in the patch is refitted; an op with no
``parts`` and no ``--parts`` is left alone.

A screw is outlined as its head and shank, a hammer T-nut as its plate and
boss — each a convex solid whose projection is the convex hull of its
edges, so the union of the hulls is the exact silhouette without relying
on hidden-line loops closing. Any other part (a whole sub-assembly, say)
is outlined by polygonizing its visible edges.
