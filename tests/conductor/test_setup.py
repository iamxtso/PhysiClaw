"""Tests for `drive.setup` — the wake's one setup call, and the two log
lines it owes every wake: the roster (every playbook on disk with its
state) and the decision (the boot drives and what it offers, or the
plain model session and the one reason). A playbook not running is
the first thing to know about a wake, so nothing here stays quiet."""
