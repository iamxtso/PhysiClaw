"""Tests for `physiclaw.debug.thread` — the virtual thread file, the
staged-reply timing rule, and the listing renderer. The render must
satisfy the REAL consumers: the listing grammar (`Screen.read`), the
page matcher (`match_screen` against the channel pack's own
fingerprint), and the reply reader's bubble geometry
(`reply.read_incoming`)."""
