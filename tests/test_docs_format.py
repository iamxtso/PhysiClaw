"""Format guards for the Starlight docs under ``docs/``.

The pages are rendered by Astro Starlight in a separate repo
(``physiclaw/docs-site``): on every push touching ``docs/``, a GitHub
Action mirrors this directory there and the site builds. That means
frontmatter mistakes surface only at deploy time, in another repo, or
never: Starlight's Zod schema *strips* unknown keys, so a misspelled
``descripton:`` deploys fine and silently ships a page with no search
snippet. These tests fail the same mistakes in the PR that makes them.

The contract they enforce comes from two places:

- Starlight's frontmatter reference
  (https://starlight.astro.build/reference/frontmatter/): ``title`` is
  required on every page.
- This repo's authoring rules (``docs/README.md``): frontmatter is just
  ``title`` + ``description`` as flat one-line scalars, pages carry no
  ESM ``import``/``export`` (the renderer injects component imports),
  every page ships as an EN/ZH pair (``foo.mdx`` + ``foo.zh.mdx``),
  and the sidebar order lives in ``docs.json``.

The frontmatter parser below is deliberately a strict subset of YAML:
flat ``key: value`` lines with plain or quoted scalar values. The docs
are parsed at deploy time by a different YAML dialect (js-yaml, 1.2)
than Python tooling would use (PyYAML, 1.1), and the dialects disagree
exactly on the ambiguous cases — so the guard accepts only scalars
that read as the same string under any dialect and rejects the rest
with a quote-it message: leading indicator characters, ``: `` or
`` #`` inside the value (the classic "colon in the description" deploy
breaker), and values YAML type-coerces away from string (``no``,
``1.20``, ``22:30``, dates). Extend the parser if the authoring
contract ever grows past flat scalars.
